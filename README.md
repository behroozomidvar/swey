# Causality Analysis using the Descriptive Power of the Social Web

Social Web is a knowledge source which contains reasons behind events. For instance, tweets in Twitter can tell us the reason of a traffic jam-pack in part of a city. In this paper, we discuss two use-cases of exploiting the Social Web for Causality Analysis. Our use-cases come from our collaborations with aviation industry and trade. We propose SWEY framework, a generic approach to quickly derive reasons from the Social Web. We also discuss challenges and future directions of this novel research direction.
